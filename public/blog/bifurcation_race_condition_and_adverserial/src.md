# Bifurcation, Race Condition, and Adversarial Initial Condition

When we make something atomic to solve race condition, we essentially *want* a perfect bifurcation. Either A happens before B, or B before A. 

There is an exact solution of a dice's initial condition so that it stays on its corner forever. 

Even with wind perturbation! As long as the wind is pre-determined, there exists a solution so that the dice dances on its corner in the wind, never falling down. I call it adversarial initial condition. 

This reminds me of a scene in 金庸's novel, where A was exhausted to death because B kept standing on him. A could not get rid of B. B found the adversarial solution to A's movements. 

Everything is continuous at a low enough level. Machines and programs are only a discrete abstraction of a continuous reality.  
Does this mean race condition is impossible to prevent? We can only move the unstable equilibrium around, but we can never eliminate it?
