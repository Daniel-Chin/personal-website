# Privilege of å¿ƒ

Lately I've been advocating a kind of philosophy where you listen to your heart. You follow moral principles because your heart wants to.  

This morning I realize recommending others to follow this principle may not make sense. I am super weird. For ten or more years I've been heavily putting myself in self-moral-doubt and self-criticism, doing relentless repr aug (Phillis, for example, showed me this kind of trial most probably isn't practiced by most people.), and I could finally unite by heart with my moral rules. They are one and the same. That's how I can now enjoy the privilege of acting in accordance with my heart. It's a great lifestyle, but it has prerequisites. I got used to it and thought everyone else should just follow their "emotional truths", without considering the prerequisites. 

Just how much of this blog is true? My intuition is: a lot. What I learn from social psychology is that people can be so biased and wrong and trapped in their own views. So I prolly need to respect other people's individual cases much more than I'm doing now.
