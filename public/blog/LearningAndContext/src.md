# Learning and context
In FoF, I realized: 

learning a subject = learn the correct context + load the complete context. 

If you make careless mistakes, then your context is not complete. Maybe you forgot to load some important "don't do"s; maybe you didn't register an event handler. 

It takes time to load the complete context. That's why we have a recap of the last lecture at the beginning of every new lecture. 

From lesson[0] to lesson[-1], students create and modify their model (context). The way to learn new things: load the context, and tweak things. The way to enhance mastery: load the context and get familiar for multiple times + practice loading the context.
