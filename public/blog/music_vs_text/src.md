# 音乐 vs 自然语言

希望用以下对话 underline 一些音乐与自然语言的区别。

## 对话
作家：邻居，请读我的新书。

邻居：Ok. 瞧，第一页写着：务必读出声！

作家：都是我安排好的阅读体验。

邻居：[阅读第一句]

作家：不对！阅读的情感不对。[抢过稿子] 让我在第一句话上增加一些语气标记...

邻居：细枝末节。有必要吗？

作家：你不懂！如果语气不对，读者怎么理解我要表达的意思？

邻居：如果读者读出来效果不是你所希望的，你应该推敲文字才是。

作家：没关系。出版后，如果读者不按照我的语气标记朗读，我将组织朗诵团... 并且，还要亲自带领他们排练...

## 节选
结尾处，我想引用《阅读心理学》中对一些实验的总结：

> "Three other studies used the Nelson-Denny test to examine the phonological processing of high- and low-skilled college readers. Jared, Levy, and Rayner (1999) measured eye movements as good and poor readers read sentences that contained a correctly spelled target, a homophone of the target, or a misspelled control. They found that poor readers were less likely to notice homophone errors than the misspelled controls. In contrast, the good readers had comparable gaze durations in the homophone and misspelled conditions—both of which were longer than gaze times on the correct target. Unsworth and Pexman (2003) conducted a lexical decision study that demonstrated poor readers were more likely to accept pseudohomophones as words than nonhomophone controls. Whereas these two studies (and several others) indicate that poor readers rely more on phonological processes to identify words than good readers do, the third experiment provides an important caveat to that conclusion. Chace, Rayner, and Well (2005) conducted an eye movement study to examine whether differences in reading skill affect parafoveal word recognition processes during silent reading. Sentences were presented that contained a target for which the parafoveal preview was either the identical word ( beach–beach), a homophone ( beech–beach), an orthographic control ( bench–beach), or a consonant string ( jfzrp). Chace et al. found that the gaze durations of the more-skilled readers were comparable in the homophone and identical preview conditions, and shorter there than in the control and consonant string conditions. In contrast, the less-skilled readers had roughly comparable mean gaze durations in all four conditions. Finally, the gaze durations of the two groups of readers did not differ in the orthographic and consonant string conditions. In sum, the Chace et al. data indicate that phonologically similar parafoveal previews reduced word recognition time for the better readers only, and that the worse readers did not benefit from any parafoveal information. Together, the findings from Jared et al. (1999), Unsworth and Pexman (2003), and Chace et al. (2005) suggest that more-skilled readers primarily process phonological information parafoveally whereas less-skilled readers are more susceptible to foveal phonological effects."
