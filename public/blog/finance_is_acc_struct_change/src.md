# Finance is the acceleration of structural change
In Von Neumann's economy simulation/model, a production process can only scale up/down with the previous year's profits/losses. Structure change, i.e. shifting/repurposing assets around the economy, is slow. Finance/the capital market allows investors to scale up/down companies according to projections of the future. Once a company is decided to be outdated, it doesn't need years of losses to empty its assets - its stock price would drop immediately. The point of Finance is the acceleration of structural change.  

It is a common misconception that "Finance can move resources along the time axis". No. Finance only ever moves resources among places, never through time.  
Finance uses humans' deduction about the future to move the current-time resources faster towards the equilibrium.
