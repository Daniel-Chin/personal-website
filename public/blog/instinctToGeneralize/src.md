# Critical Thinking and the Instinct to Generalize
How to succeed in College with a Finance degree? Here is my answer. 

Whenever you learn/discover something new (`this`), ask:  
* How can `this` be wrong?  
* Can I find some counter examples?  
* How can I derive/prove `this` myself?  
* Is `this` necessary? Are there easier ways to explain the same phenomena?  
* Can I see `this` as a sub-component or a natural consequence of something else?  
* Can I generalize `this` to other domains or to higher abstraction levels?  
* In what environments does `this` hold true?  

Note that all the above are O(1). If you are ambitious and okay with O(N), do the following too:  
* How does `this` contradict/agree with other things I already learnt?  
* Joining `this` with other things I already learnt, what new results can be obtained?  

I recommend doing the O(N) part in offline mode (i.e. instead of doing it every lecture (event-based), do it every month (pooling-based)).  

Summary: **Develop a habit of critical thinking and an instict to attempt to generalize**.
