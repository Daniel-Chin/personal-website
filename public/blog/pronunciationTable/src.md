# Pronunciation Discoveries
Shuwen Zuo posted a PYQ: "Avocado sounds like Affogato". 

It got me thinking about pronuciations. It has been the first time I revisit this topic after maybe middle school. Many things look clear now: 

**"1": First plosive with air, then vocal cord vibrates.**  
**"2": Vocal cord starts to vibrate exactly when the plosion happens.** (I feel this concurrency is not facilitated by neural reflex. It is physics. Imagine the vocal cord braces itself in such a way that a sudden decrease in air pressure would start the osscilation. It's like turning on a drive force proportional to displacement and waiting for the first push.)  
**"3": Vocal cord starts vibrating before the plosive evnet.** (Because the mouth is closed, air comes out from the nose. That's prolly why they are called nasal sounds.)

Most are PinYin, 6 are Western.  
* PinYin c and z are replaced by Western ts and ds to avoid confusion. 
* s and z and th and "th!" are Western. 

Mouth volume decreases: m > vm ~= thn > n > nn  

_LF: 漏风。 Nasal sound impossible

?: Can exist but doesn't. Maybe in another language. 

Notice the last five lines can be sustained. 
* si, zzzz (western z), xi, yi, shi, ri, hu (but smaller mouth), wu

"th!": just the "th" in the word "the". 

"H" is so confusing. I don't know how it works.
