# Understand Equations
I realized this in FoF, Foundation of Finance.  
There was this equality:  
```
	equilibrium tangency portfolio weights
	=
	Market protfolio weights
```

At first, the only way I could make sense of it is:  
"This has to be obeyed, otherwise things fall inconsistent."  
i.e., to me, the equation is a "true" one. 

Later, the prof showed how this is actually the result of an equilibrium.  
If things deviate, the equation will be resetored as time goes by.  

Notice the transition?  
**True equation -> equilibrium describer**  
bringing more insights.  

Now think about physical laws.  
Classical Phys laws can now be described as the statistical expected behaviour of the sum of quantum events.  
Maybe more laws that we now think is "always true" is actually the result of some kind of equilibrium?  
Conservation of mass+energy? Conservation of momentum?  

For example, I thought of this earlier: time travel.  
If the world is an automatic cell machine, then maybe the rule is not deterministic. The system has a fifth dimension of time, the "real one". And whatever happens in the system along the fourth dimension, "our time", is just the result of an equilibrium happening in five dimensions. By injecting energy, we can change and sustain the change of cause and effect, enabling us to alter events in the past.
