# Between 2 and 3
According to my [Dice Simulation](https://github.com/Daniel-Chin/DiceSim#dice-simulation), there exists an exact initial condition such that a dice stands on its edge forever. 

The conclusion is more general than you may think. Given any dynamic wind condition, there also exists an exact initial condition such that a dice stands on its edge forever. In fact, this result applies when a continuous system takes a continuous input and something decides a discrete output within finite time. I call this "bifurcation". 

Now, assume time is continuous and the physical rules are continuous. Consider this experiment. Play two beeps to a human, and ask, is the interval more like 2 seconds or 3 seconds? Make it clear that the human can only answer either 2 or 3, and that saying anything else means the human has gone crazy. By the continuous setup, there exists an exact time interval between the two beeps such that the human never answers either 2 or 3 within finite time. The two beeps have made the human go crazy. 

It's cognitohazard.
