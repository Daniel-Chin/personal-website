# My dad is a master of oversimplification and I am an extremist

TOFEL writing prompts you to "consider the complexity of the issue". My dad doesn't. He is a master of oversimplification. He can always find a way to circumvent ambiguity and paradox when reasoning. When he sorts out a social or scientific issue for you, he oversimplifies the logic and presents an appealing, self-consistent, and most importantly, simple, narrative. That kind of narrative tends to be popular among friends, because light-hearted discussions about social and scientific topics among friends tend to favor the conflict-resolving, balance-restoring effect of oversimplification, dislike the cumbersome fair treatment of the complex issue, and fears tolerating ambiguity. He who properly treats the complexity of the issue suffers from the curse of not being able to explain himself in under a minute. Many issues deserve a balanced, mixed approach, but my dad can just creatively devise a new narrative "why didn't they just do *that*?" In this regard, my dad is an extremist (even though he always educates my bro and I to be non-extreme) because oversimplification leads to one-sidedness. The justifications for the other side is completely simplified away. Is that why my mom called my dad an extremist several times?

My dad has been full of his oversimplifying narratives since I was a kid. Was it harmful to my mental development? I don't think so (wishful thinking?): I tried to learn the same ability to come up with such "convincing" narratives. It was good for training critical thinking: how do you find a way to escape the existing narrative and conjure up new ground-breaking perspectives that sound plausible? It was a good exercise. But going forward that was not enough; there was a next level of intelligence. 

Oversimplification is appealing because it eludes ambiguity, making your mind at ease. My dad is so mentally balanced because he avoids imbalance. However, this practice also makes the truth elude you. Canceller Lehman of NYUSH once told us that one objective of our undergrad education was to make us "tolerate ambiguity". I increasingly find that a valuable quality.

Am I not an extremist though? Recall:
- What I told those young applicants during the Statement of Purpose workshops.
- What I told Will Huang about how I chose to follow Gus's advising.
- My entire logic and attitude towards Liwei.
- Art.
- Politics. 

I am so extreme in so many regards. My own internal explanation is: I've come to understand just how many superficial things in this world are utterly meaningless and worthless --- Of course my value system will have sparse loadings! You may call that a Zen/Buddha/figured-it-all-out mindset, but that doesn't make it any less extremist. 

Maybe being extreme can be profitable in a crowded landscape. Think about investment. That has changed. In old times there was a proper good way to do business and that was predictable. Now, investors put diverse bets on all kinds of crazy entrepreneurs hoping to get the next Elon Musk. What happened? Ample competition mutes whatever efforts to play things safe. People adapted. A heavy-tail distribution characterizes the modern world. 

Think about research. Do you want:  
(A) 100 teams to do research that makes sense, or  
(B) 20 teams to do research that makes sense and 80 teams to follow their own diverse, strong philosophical tendencies? Crazy teams? *Extreme* teams?  

Maybe, funding research as a nation is not be too different from high-risk investing. 

I am not proud of being extreme. I am just extreme.
