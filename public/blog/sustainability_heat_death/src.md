# Sustainability, equilibrium, and heat death
We have been looking for equilibriums.  
Mechanism design, to make society sustainbale.  
Study of humanity, to distill what it means to be human, hoping we always be like so. 

Heat death, the final and strongest equilibrium, on the other hand, we dread the most.  
Or, what if the universe cycles, and nothing new happens? 

Do you see the conflict between sustainability and variability?  
We fear change, and we fear imprisonment.
