# A way to take down child porn Tor hidden services 
## Abstract
Proposal: Extend the Tor protocol to support taking down an unwanted hidden service if >50% people (Tor nodes) wish so. Agreeable hidden services can still run anonymously. 

## Full Text
Tor mainly provides two things: Hidden Clients and Hidden Services. 

Hidden Clients: For example, with Tor Browser or Tor VPN you can connect to servers anonymously. Tutorial: [https://youtu.be/QRYzre4bf7I](https://youtu.be/QRYzre4bf7I)

Hidden Services: You can host a hidden service with Tor. Users can still form a connection with your server, but tracing the traffic to your server is impossible. Tutorial: [https://youtu.be/lVcbq_a5N9I](https://youtu.be/lVcbq_a5N9I)

Tor Hidden Services can help facilitate free speech. However, today many Hidden Services are illegal and immoral. The one big example is child pornography platforms. Because of them, production of child pornography becomes a profitable crime. Sadly, nobody is able to trace the servers, let alone shut them down. Although those immoral platforms have their "consumers", it must be the case that (much, much) more than 50% of the people want them to be gone. Is there a way? 

The Bitcoin blockchain is susceptible to "51% attack". Similarly, if the majority of Tor nodes agree to expose a specific Hidden Service, then the hosters will have to choose between stopping the service and welcoming the Police to their server room. 

The idea is still vague. I am thinking that each Tor node can publishe a list of hidden services it is willing to take down. Then we will need a decentralized way to verify that >50% nodes share a same idea. 

Challenges: 

* What if the critical threshold turns out to be way below 50%? 
* What if it is not a stable equilibrium - Tor nodes quickly dissolve into hostile parties with disagreeing protocols and we lose Tor? 
* Is it even possible? 
* Every person is equal; not every Tor node.
