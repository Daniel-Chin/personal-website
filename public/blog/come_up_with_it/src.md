# Come up with it
An education program

Math, Econ...

You come up with methods and models yourself.

For example,  
* You give the defenition of limit.
* You come up with how to find the mid point of a line segment with ruler compass.
* You come up with the Micro Econ model for firm decision.
* come up with MLA (the citation style).

If you really can't come up with it, you can also "be taught".  
Your grade is the percentage of models you come up with.  
You are also encouraged to come up with your own methods and models.
