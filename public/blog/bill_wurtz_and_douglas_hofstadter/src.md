## Lyrics of "tuesday" by bill wurtz
> I'm 'a say something dumb  
> at the top of the song.   
> and it'll be approximately four bars  
> long.   
> Then I'm gonna show you how to change the world.   
> Then I'm gonna show you how to make it cool.   
> Go home.   
> Write poems.   
> and wear a nice coat...  
> and before you know it,   
> it'll be Tuesday.   
> It'll be tuesday and that's ok.   

## The Crab's "A Song Without Time or Season" in "Edifying Thoughts of a Tobacco Smoker" in *Godel, Escher, Bach* by Douglas Hofstadter
> A turner of phrases quite pleasin',   
> Had a penchant for trick'ry and teasin'.   
> In his songs, the last line  
> Might seem sans design;  
> What I mean is, without why or wherefore.   

## Remark
The closing remark of this blog, instead of summarizing the resemblance between the two songs, references itself as a salute to the above works.
