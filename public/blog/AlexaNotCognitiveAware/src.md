# Non-socializing with Alexa 

Social Psychology is interested in how a social situation influences people's thinking and behaviors. 

Before Alexa, whenever I talk, as long as I am not talking to myself, I am self-aware. The presence of other people makes me talk differently. Even when I talk into a voice recorder, I am self-aware because in the end another human will hear the recordings.  

I am not self-aware when I talk to Alexa. 

In this sense, talking to Alexa is a brand new talking experience. I knew how to be self-unaware when not talking. I knew how to talk when self-aware. But, I had never organized words while being self-unaware.  

It is also unlike talking to myself because Alexa needs to understand my words. Alexa will understand my words but will not judge me or remember anything I say in the long term. This creates an experience that is novel and wild.
