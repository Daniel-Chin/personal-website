# Words and Games
This is a reflection on a flash game. 

I don't remember its name. It's about a trans having difficulties living in society. 

The game is short. The art is minimal. The texts are short.  
But to this day, I still remember it. It got the message through.  

I saw signs in front of NYU restrooms saying "you can go in as long as your sexual identity conforms".  
If I didn't play the game, I would probably be very confused.  
This game not even got the message through, but also changed my first impression, or even attitiude, to a phenomenon later observed in my life.  

In terms of communication, why did the game work? If the same idea was published in writing, would it be as successful?  

I think *words* are good at conveying abstract, semantic ideas **at first glance**.  
*Games* and *pictures* are good at conveying specific, embodied views **at first glance**.  

Steven Pinker said the job of a writer is to direct the readers' view to a specific angle.  
If we take the flash game and remove the game and only leave the text,  
still, a story is told. But the reader won't pay attention, treating it as some general abstract story of societal uninclusiveness faced by just another stranger.  
That is because the readers' view is not so easily directed in few lines.  
But Pictures and Games is able to quickly get specific and immersive.  
You can relate with the artist at first glance.  

*Words* are good at conveying abstract, semantic ideas **at first glance**.  
*Games* and *pictures* are good at conveying specific, embodied views **at first glance**.  
*Words* cannot let the reader relate at first glance.  
*Games* and *pictures* are generally bad at conveying abstract ideas.  
(It is hard to illustrate abstract ideas.)
