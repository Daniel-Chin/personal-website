# P is NP Nicky Case
Nicky Case was onto something. He wasn't sure whether he proved P=NP or not, but published an MD5 hash of his early sketches anyway:  
```
C0FD20B65B51423D670D9A63D3CB324D
```

## So what? 
I repost the hash here to make it more distributed. 

## Side joke
If P=NP, wouldn't cracking a hash become trivial?  

Using a hash to verify a P=NP proof somehow gives me a strong GEB vibe...
