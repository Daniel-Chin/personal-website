## What's Bell's inequality?

## So...
Bell's inequality emerges because sin^2(theta/2) does not have a linear response to theta. Manhattan (L1) distance solves this. 

In an L1 world, 
- pi = 4. 
- cos and sin are piecewise linear. 
- There is no bell's inequality. 
- Triangle wave is pure tone. 

Our world is L2, which is very crooked.
