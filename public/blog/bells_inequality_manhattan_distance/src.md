## So...
Bell's inequality emerges because sin^2(theta/2) does not have a linear response to theta. Manhattan (L1) distance solves this. 

In an L1 world, 
- pi = 4. 
- cos and sin are piecewise linear. 
- Quantum disentanglement would be explainable via hidden variable. We have realism + locality. 
- Triangle wave is pure tone. 

Our world is L2, which is very crooked.

Evidently, there's something very circular about the normal distribution, and it's related to Pi, and related to sin and cos.  

In the alternate reality, the normal distribution would not be so circular, and the hidden variable theory would work.
