# Notable games
An (unordered) list of notable games I played. 

In the game comments, by "structural beauty" I mean some artistic layout of structure. The structure can be of rooms, levels, stories, etc. Many GEB-related artistic expressions can be thought of as structural beauty.

    - In most horror games, the horror is the unwanted, the boundary condition of gameplay, and the to-be-avoided. In Phasmophobia, the horror is your central subject, the foci of gameplay, and the to-be-confronted. A simple twist, but an clever one.
