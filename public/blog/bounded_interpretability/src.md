# Bounded Interpretability
Daniel:  
> I think BDI and other cognitive metaphysics trying to explain how I think are not how I think but only how I explain and make sense of myself. My thinking is not interpretable. It is flat, wild, black-box, and uninterpretable. I only make it partially and artificially interpretable for inter-person understanding. What is this school of thought?

GPT-o1:  
> What you’re describing aligns closely with perspectives in post-cognitivist and anti-representationalist schools of thought. These perspectives challenge traditional cognitive metaphysics, which often rely on frameworks like Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) and representational models to describe mental processes. Let's break down the core ideas related to your description:
> 
> **Anti-representationalism**: This is the idea that mental states don’t need to be representational or interpretable in the traditional sense. Anti-representationalists argue that our thinking doesn’t consist of discrete beliefs, desires, or intentions that can be parsed or fully understood by introspection or external analysis. Instead, cognition is “flat” in that it’s emergent, continuous, and only interpretable in partial and context-dependent ways.
> 
> **Embodied and Enactive Cognition**: These perspectives suggest that cognition isn’t something that just happens in the mind but is fundamentally connected to the body, the environment, and our interactions with the world. Here, mental processes are seen as “wild,” dynamic, and always evolving rather than fixed, discrete states or neatly categorized thoughts.
> 
> **Post-cognitivism**: This is an umbrella term for frameworks that critique classical cognitive theories. Post-cognitivists argue that traditional cognitive science oversimplifies human thought and behavior, emphasizing that cognition doesn’t operate according to neatly structured, interpretable states but is instead a more mysterious, black-box process that is only artificially interpretable for the sake of social interaction.
> 
> **Radical Constructivism**: This is another relevant school of thought, proposing that reality is constructed in our minds and isn’t an objective truth that we can fully access or explain. Here, knowledge and understanding are seen as constructs built through interaction, not as transparent reflections of our “real” thinking processes.
> 
> These frameworks support the idea that the mind’s internal processes are opaque even to ourselves and are made interpretable primarily for social coherence rather than for genuine insight into our own thoughts.
