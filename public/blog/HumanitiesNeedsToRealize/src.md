# Humanity Conflict
The study of humanity: what are the essential traits of being human?  
Most people would like humans to always be humans.  

However, the human traits are created by the purpose of human in the early days: survival. 

If we are to preserve the *purpose* (survival), the traits will necessarily change. 

If we are to preserve the *current traits* of human, we have to change the purpose. 

Those two cannot be preserved together. When you say you want humans to always be humans, you have to clarify which one you want to preserve. 

This conflict is at the core of many others.
