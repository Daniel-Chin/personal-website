# Self-descriptive words
I read about this concept in one of my childhood-favorite book, Aha Gotcha, by Martin Gardner.  

## His examples
- short: only five letters
- polysyllabic: five syllables
- self-descriptive: meta
- Non-self-descriptive: Russell's Paradox

## My addition
- extraneous: an extra way of saying extra
- concept: a concept
- metaconcept: concept about concepts
- abbr: abbreviation of "abbreviation"
- suggestive
- abstract
