# Expertise and Empathy
Expertise may make it harder for a person to empathize with the mass. 

A marketing person, having studied consumer psychology, may find it hard to feel their customers in their shoes, because psychology training has made them resistent to cognitive biases. People tend to mistakenly assume that others are like them. 

A psyco therapist meets a patient. The patient's problems, under the therapist's cogitive model, may be different from how the patient views them, precisely because the therapist studied psychology. This creats a gap between the patient and the therapist. 

I saw a lottery ad on TV in New Jersey. It has a small chance to win you a perpetuity. Now, training in Finance has taught me that people tend to significantly over-feel the value of perpetuity. I, taking interest rate into account, find the lottery utterly worthless. The hazzard, therefore, is for me to conclude that this marketing trick is worthless. "People won't fall for it!" was my initial thought, but then I realized that Expertise may make it harder for a person to empathize with the mass.
