# 轻声关门

我以往打交道的门都有很强的 damper, 因此我没有养成小心关门的习惯. 

第一天, 我不知道新宿舍门没有 damper, so the door slammed loudly. 

Day 2. A split second before the door slammed, my brain predicted the loud slam. I tried to reach for the door, but I was too late. Slam. 

Day 3. Half a second before the door slammed, my brain predicted that "at the next moment I will predict a slam". I immediately reached for the door, but it was still too late. Slam. 

Day 4. One second before the door slammed, my brain predicted that "next, I will predict that 'at the next moment I will predict a slam'". I immediately reached for the door, and stopped it.
