# Kids should not learn Algorithms
In Psychology, "algorithm" refers to the kind of human intelligence that relies on set protocols to solve problems. 

We should not teach our kids specific algos; we should teach them to come up with new ones. 

I looked at Yiyi's online class last week. They were teaching how to count boxes stacked in 3D, and they taugh 标顶法。 Follow the algo, you will get the correct results. In a Chinese lesson, 比字句 was taught. 熊猫比老虎重。是谁更重？ They taught detailed algorithm to solve questions like this. 熊猫是队长，不能先出场，先把老虎放在数轴上，再放队长，看“重”，所以往重里放。 I don't think this teaches natural language understanding. This teaches shuffling of symbols. 

These are extreme examples, but even in *my* education, there are too many specific algos taught.
