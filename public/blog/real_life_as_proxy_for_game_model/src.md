# Real life as the proxy of a game's world model

When done right, a game can invite its new players to use the real world as the proxy of the game's world model. This require:  
1. realism. 
2. complexity. 

## What do I mean by "proxy"? 
When you get too familiar with a game, you know its world model by heart, and you can optimize your play. The game becomes a number's game. The game is so clearly understood that it cannot represent reality. 

But, when you first started to play, you did not know the game's world model so well. Maybe you used the real world as the proxy to make decisions. Instead of asking, "Will this action lead to my game goals?" you may instead ask, "If I encountered this situation in reality, what would I do?"

This is a desirable effect for many games in terms of player engagement. 

## Realism
To achieve that, the game first needs to have good realism. If the player makes a decision and later learns that the game aligns with the real world very well, they are encouraged to keep doing that. 

An example is Cataclysm:DDA. The complex game dares to offer almost no tutorial! That is because when people wonder "how do I do certain things in the game", they should just ask "how do I do this in the real world?" and try that in the game. If there are multiple ways of doing it, chances are that the game has all of them implemented. 

## Complexity
Another requirement is complexity. It must be relatively costly for the player to learn the world model of the game. I guess this is just an extension to the "realism" requirement - because it is always impossible to fully capture reality's complexity, you always miss something. The better you add realism to your game, the more complex the game will turn out to be. 

Because the cost of learning the game's world model is high, the player is invited to simply use the real world as a decision-making heuristic. 

Take one of my recent experience as example. I picked up Stellaris after not playing for some years. When I faced some decisions, e.g. democracy vs authority & xenophile vs xenophobe, I vaguely recalled the fact that the civics were related to many many other systems in the game, including policies, edicts, populations, factions, and diplomacy, and they in turn affected yet other things. The complexity of the game made me feel assured that using reality as a proxy was not a bad idea. So I picked the civic according to my real-life beliefs. 

In this light, Cataclysm:DDA also fulfills the complexity requirement. First of all, the player is allowed to do a wide range of things in various combinations. In other words, the character control needs to be expressive enough. Then, the game features so many inter-related subsystems, the player is encouraged not to learn the math of every subsystem, but rather, treat it as reality. This is related to [Mark Brown's "Systemic games" video](https://youtu.be/SnpAAX9CkIc). 

## The benefits
For me, once a game becomes a number's game, it loses its fun. I can play the game in my head. I can solve the equilibrium. The game becomes trivial. Games with random chances cannot be predicted, but the risk-minimization tactic can again be simulated in advance. 

Therefore, a game that invites me to treat it as the reality offers sufficient depth for me, because to me, reality is not trivially predictable. 

A counterargument: Even if a game is trivial, the player can still voluntarily "give in" and "buy" the role playing. An example is Space Agency sandbox mode. The game is pretty predictable, but people still put effort into building interesting space stations. People add Oxygen Gardens to fill their space stations with oxygen even when astronauts are not added to the game yet.
