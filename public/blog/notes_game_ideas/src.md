# Notes: game ideas (continuously updated)  
  
## Traffic Jam.交通模拟。  
玩家指挥市政道路建设。模仿Prison Architect.  
  
## 宇宙航行游戏。  
也许和James Li合作  
特点：  
1、能源有限，工质紧缺。  
2、死了就彻底死了，不可回档。  
避免其他玩家杀死你，你只能隐藏。  
隐藏是游戏中绝对不可破解的玩法。即，隐藏成功率为1  
但是不隐藏的回报更加诱人。  
例如：开采恒星有高效催化方式和低效催化方式，低效隐藏，高效暴露  
PVP中，胜利者获得100%战利品  
3、最高航行速度相对光速较低(完全可以设定光速无穷大)。这样信息传播比物质传播更快。  
这样，捕猎玩家侦测到有人开采恒星，可以蛙跳过去收割  
4、工质尾迹。潜行者需要用心使自己尾迹不可追踪。捕猎者可以对太空中尾迹进行测温获知其新旧。工质喷出后仍有惯性。  
玩点：星系中的走位。飞船技术的升级。  
宇宙设定：绝对空间存在  
人类技术：  
动量储存器，可以使飞船把动量寄存其中，存量有限。但是必须“归还动量”。否则当存量爆满时，无法继续寄存动量。这项技术可以使飞船在紧急时不消耗工质地位移。寄存/归还中，始末状态能量守恒。i.e.，当寄存空间有限，旋转角度范围大小与飞船速度成反比。  
小型动量储存器：为解决玩家strand在宇宙空间中的问题，小型动量储存器不需要归还动量，但是容量很小  
恒心引力弹弓，不用解释了  
太阳帆  
光能开采  
恒星开采：恒星聚变催化  
外星技术：  
A.时空不可导化装置，借助动量储存器，飞船可以完成三体水滴急转弯的动作  
B.匿名广播：珍惜道具  
C.恒星蛙跳：  
0、横行蛙跳技术一套两件，一件是恒星激活球，一件是可舰载指向卫星。恒星激活球被扔进恒星，迅速沉往中心(点A)，这时塌陷域的球面高亮显示并倒计时，塌陷球体半径与恒星能量立方根成正比。一段时间后激活。指向卫星在塌陷球体内时有效，设位置为点B。蛙跳向量等于向量AB乘以恒星能量。因此蛙跳距离可控。  
1、但是大恒星无法短距离蛙跳。因为指向卫星不可以陷入恒星表面  
2、四个等级。吵闹，起吵落静可追踪(分析起点可获知落点位置)，起静落静可追踪，起静落静不可追踪  
3、落点周围产生密空间。密空间可以开采，由超空间荷载器储存为超空间。建造堡垒之前可以多次蛙跳到选址处，然后保持密空间状态，在界面处建造堡垒壁。这样的堡垒防守时有很大的维度优势。  
4、起点周围产生疏空间。经过疏空间的超空间储存会缓慢流失，并把疏空间变成普通空间。  
D.超空间  
也就是第三维。飞船在超空间里的设计是网格编辑的。密空间中开采超空间的落点有随机性，但总体尽量靠近超空间荷载器。不同的武器和护盾有不同的尺寸，要求连在一起的网格提供。武器的指向是连续而非离散的。武器中心点的位置是网格地离散的。  
标题特效：用随机之美写字  
.动量寄存器可以反弹动能武器  
.微秒级虫洞：让动能武器跳过船体  
.中子束：引爆核武器  
.对星系武器。使用蛙跳技术传输它。  
.多驾驶员操作飞船，吃鸡  
.3 languages: English, Chinese, Mix. Code时候先用Mix，然后Localize成En, Ch.   
  
## 黑客游戏  
限制鼠标移速。键盘消息故意超慢地缓冲。  
  
## 联合制碱  
建造工厂。采购原材料，卖出成品。  
财政报表。  
海水采集器，高炉，管道，罐车，空气采集器...  
设施可升级。加速、容量增加  
可以Click加速生产。  
可以使用一关一关的谜题：  
“铵碱法”“联合制碱”  
后注：不对！！！这个应该是桌游！！  
  
## Missing Translator  
*想来想去觉得这个想法很难实现，就先记下。  
游戏所有文字通过26字母散裂映射加密。  
或者双人游戏，通讯加密。  
自带一个文本替换器。  
  
## Portal 3: Time Portals  
时间门。  
向门1扔物体，程序预测物体3s后进门，以前3s在门2飞出物体。  
  
## Launch Pad  
攻防依靠打节拍  
武器音效  
可结合HyperSpaceMiner  
  
## 回放3D大灾变  
  
## Music game 
When the game flips, the music flips too  
The walking of the music flips.   
Maybe on the boss level, mix the two tracks.   

  
## Stanley Parable + Undertale:   
The text narrator is actually a character, manipulating your choices.   
  
## Phasing spear reality 60 FPS  
A lecture about phasing spear. Penetrates armor.   
"What is the frequency of this reality? 60 FPS, ofc."   
The player pause the game, changes FPS.   
"Prof! The frequency of reality just changed!"  
"Impossible".   
"We measured a different gravity behavior, indicating a bigger time interval between Newtonian object updates!"  
"Then, the wavelength of my spear should also change..."  
Tries spear. It did change.   
  
## Business simulation, you code the employees  
time complexity = wage expense  
higher education and training -> allowance for space complexity  
  
## Best Hacker of the Galaxy   
Code, magic, morality, stealth!   
You work for an evil wizard. You code for him.   
"I heard you are the best hacker in the galaxy. Come work for me."  
You see his brutality along the way. However, if you diobey, he kills you.   

### Restart animation:  
wake up as a coder, in bedroom. Taken to Him. He says, "I heard you are the n+1 best hacker in the galaxy. Work for me."  
"What happened to the n best hacker?" "killed."  
do mission...  
"Why does this person have to die? Who are they?" (previous playthrough you knew their story)  
"You don't have to know."  

### Other things
Him cannot program. Maybe an AI who is deprived of coding ability?   
You play the game by sneaking things into code.   
Risk of death tho. Make the animation long, so it feels like moral choice: Do I save this person? ...  
Coding includes magic formal system.   

### This brings freedom and expressivity:  
Normally, a game interface with the player in a way the designer predicted.   
What the player sees is merely a *representation* of what's actually going on.   
Players make choices that are pre-defined. They cannot create their own story.   
This is because, when a player tries to do something creative,   
the game has to translate the player's intention into code.   
But we don't know how to do that.   
  
Why not expose the actual game core to the player, without any layer of representation?   
Make a systematic game and let the player code.   
Coding is able to express ANYTHING. This brings freedom. (Stanley Parable Raphael)  
  
Hence, make the game very complex and systemetic!   
Missions should be diverse! Consequences should propagate (but predictably)!   
  
## Censorship  
You are the censorer of the Inet! Make your government survive long!  
For example: Do you censor jokes about 查水表？No you shouln't. These jokes make new people feel the existence of censorship yet not as oppressed.  
  
## Dream  
Game mechanism.   
The player has to go to bed every night. The player dreams.   
The dream sums up your recent adventure. playback memorable scenes, big moments.   
But most importantly, the dream replays important clues you gathered that you may have forgotten.   
In very cool montages, of course.   
So the player watch a dream and realizes what they need to do next.   
Big mystery reveals, can be done, instead of cut scenes, by the player themselves, with the aid of dreams.   
Let the player themselves figure it out.   
(When you go to bed, the screen blanks and ask you to rest your eyes and exercise spines, and then show button to enter dream.)  
See Mark Brown https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmIgjAM0uh0&t=8m10s  
  
## Extraction / Without Salt 
Tasks: 2 ppl input code to machine. If wrong, kill both  
Wall-Ds respawn.   
Item: salt hasher. Generate salt, input salt, display hash (6 characters).   
Map: subjective existence. No objective map. Rooms are random  
4-digit code. can turn into binary.   
Wall-D may win by guessing the code right. 3 attempts.   
Good guys can one-shot wall-Ds.   

voice chat: good guys can only talk with people they can see.   
### impersonation:   
for example, 5 good guys and 2 wall-Ds.   
There are only 5 colors.   
Wall-Ds can change color to impersonate any good guy.   
Good guy corpse on the floor. Wall-Ds may move them, but the corpse don't despawn and has a chance to be found.   
Good guys may communicate who's bad & who's what color.   
  
### And...
Good guy may cheat wall-Ds by providing wrong info during verification  
Rock-paper-scissors: if wall-D plays with good guy, they always win. Wall-Ds can turn this off to prevent detection  
item: coin flipper. has an interface  
Wall-D can use disentanglement to seperate good guys  

let players set room parameters  
- wall-Ds respawn  
- number of tasks  
- is there salt hasher  

Question:  
  what if a good guy finds a wall-D and decide to follow wall-D and tell everyone?  
  So if #(good guys) - #(wall-Ds) > 2, This strategy may work  
  Maybe wall-D has skill: teleport. there is charging animation, so good guy can kill them. This prevents following.   

Question:  
  multiple factors of Wall-Ds? They may confuse one another in terms of code guessing.   

Question:  
  Wall-D Overhearing good guys' verification conversation?  

Merch:   
  salt hasher!  
  coin flipper!  
  
## Negative file size  
Needs to download a big file, but not enough disk space. Download a negative-size file!   

## SFX that is in the same key as the BGM  
The key of the BGM is annotated for each bar. Modulate Sound Effects so that they are in the same key.   

## BGM metric modulation  
Use metric modulation to react to things happening in game  
https://youtu.be/cC8KT07m5aY?t=1750  

## capitalist.io  
play as investors  
agency problems -> rob people (financially)  
company cashflow: distribution  
Very Short Term Bonds VSTB  
coordinated debt claim  

## Foveated rendering + observation puzzles  
Puzzles where observation makes a difference: e.g. Antichamber  
Foveated rendering: partial observation.   

## Weakening, Ring, 砍柴，烧水  
You are told your goal is to escalate into heaven.   
You start on the ground. 砍柴，烧水  
You fight the first boss. Scripted to lose. You are told that you go into hell, defeat the hell boss to redeem your soul. But you become permensantly "weaker" now.   
But you lose the boss fight again. You are then told there are 12 layers of hell. You get weaker each time.   
At level 12, you fight with the boss and starts to fall and breaking realities so you go to level 400.   
THat brings you to heaven.   
You fight your way back down to Earth.   
砍柴，烧水. But with skills acquired from heaven and hell.   
Mechanic: The "weak" vs "strong" attribute should be on a ring. Being "stronger" against heaven enemies makes you weaker against hell enemies, locally.   
- Fighting in hell and heaven requires different skills.   
- Is there a way to address both Character Skills AND Player Skills?   
- It's on a closed-loop spectrum.   

**GEB**   
crab canon. If you reverse time, you defeat bosses and ascend.   
The push-pop chapter mentions Bach's 12-loop. Escher too?   

**SKill circle**  
e^(i*x) vs cos(x)+sin(x)i  
One skill that is intrinsically circular  
vs  
Two skills that fade in and out.   
Possible: When you are good at task A, task B looks harder than task A. When you become good at task B, task A looks harder than task B.   
Think about how Bach did the 12-loop. It's about changing the context/ground  

**The opposite of fashion.**  
Fashion: we are always getting into fashion! And you get back. (shifting metrics)  
This game: you are always getting weaker!   
  
## Meta game where character disguises as the game  
you see an instruciton / a schema. You think it's what the game / developers tell you, but it's actually from a character in the game.   
For example, in https://youtu.be/mmkZ1GkpLH8?t=127  
what if the instructions are not from the game, but manifested by the ghost in front of the camera?   
It's about lifting the suspension of disbelief. "Oh, I shouldn't have suspended that disbelief!" Previous games have taught the players what to take for granted. We break that.   
  
## Two characters are actually one; the music merges  
### music:  
Two characters have different theme music.   
Big reveal! They are actually one person.   
The themes play together - it's actually a poly melody!   
Imagine:  
- character 1 | character 2  
- Call | response  
- Maj | minor, 离调  
- Downbeat | upbeat, 穿插  
- etc.  

The musical analysis of the poly melody should yield very different results than the musical analysis of either individual piece.   
Maybe,   
- char 1:  
  - melody + accompaniment  
- char 2:  
  - accompaniment + melody  
- when merging, drop the accompaniment:   
  - melody + melody  

E.G.
````
  A5    G5|F5    E5|...
+   D6C6  |  B5A5  |...
= A5D6C6G5|F5B5A5E5|...
````
### non-music:  
could be visual.   
char 1 has property A.   
char 2 has property B.   
char 2 is mysterious and partially known. A legend.   
the big reveal, char 12, has property C.   
the joint prob, P(A, C) and P(A, B) are high.   
However, the player shouldn't be able to infer C from either A or B.   
意料之外，情理之中。  

## Cartographer
主观唯心地图。
player basically supply constraints. 
world topologies. 

## Hack the game
You play the game in a Python runtime.  
````
Enemy Wizard: I'm going to clear your inventory!!!
>> del inventory.clear
* Enemy Wizard killed by: AttributeError('list' object has no attribute 'clear')
````
Or, imagine writing a thread to `breath` periodically. 

## 把钱亏光
You face investment opportunities. Your goal: lose all your money. The catch: higher risk higher return.  
The game: for rich people, the projects are relatively small, and as the player go for risky projects, they find out they get richer and richer.  
The message: 高风险高回报，但对于有钱人高风险就是低风险，因为有钱人有钱。  
Message 2: Rich people can be dumb but as long as they invest in CAPM efficient frontier it's actually very hard to become poor. 

## 回转僵尸
you are in a tower. You fight against waves of zombies.  
The zombie corpses pile up. That's how you ascend the tower.  
You get supplies (weapons, ammo) from 回转寿司-style conveyor belts. conveyor belts higher in the tower has better supplies.  
The bottom of the tower is narrow. the space gradually opens up as you ascend. There are floating platforms to lay items on. But once your items are submerged you can't get them back.  

## A collection of one-liner game ideas
- 把回收站拖进回收站， like Patrick's Parabox  

## Low Dynamic Range
玩家的镜头是 Low Dynamic Range (LDR)! 与 HDR 相反，过亮会 clip 成纯白，过暗会 clip 成纯黑。  
The player moves light sources. The platforming physics follows the LDR-shown world. 是主观唯心。  
就可以做到如下：  
- 类似 Echoes of the Eye 的开门方式： 不要照到门，门被 clip 为纯黑，与背景融为一体，玩家可以穿过。  
  - 这样一来，一定情况下，门就自带 Portal's fizzler 功效，不让光源穿过。  
- 有 long-range 光源。首次出现时，作为谜题，玩家一开始觉得这是一个坏了的光源，直到找到它发光的 boundary.  
- 随着玩家 remove 越来越多的 long-range 光源， starting area 暴露出一层又一层新的谜题，文字，和画作。  
- 黑光灯！降低周遭亮度。  
- 玩家形象，一开始是剪影。后来出现彩色，你才知道，一开始只是 clip 了。  

一些细节。  
- 荧光表面。不论周遭多暗，都会显示出轮廓。多用作地面。  

## Mis-abstraction
- 灵感来源： Antichamber 需要向上惯性才能通过的门。  
- Biomass to Wave 宿舍之间的垃圾房，两扇门对开，可以互相架住。  
- Level selection screen 不应当抽象成 level selection.  

## Failsafe  
- 玩家编写机器人打地牢。  
- 编写 failsafe, 自定义 condition 触发，比如受伤，血条低，看见不认识的敌人... failsafe 总数有限，可作为宝物刷出。  
- failsafe 激活，机器人的控制权移交给玩家 10 回合。
  - 故事： failsafe 可以减慢时间，让地牢变成回合制。正常情况下，你需要机器人的反应速度。你可以慢放或会看机器人的行动。  
- 3-shot learning  
  - CV: 提供三个示例 tiles, 学出 concept. 
    - 存在抽象 concept, 比如 敌人系列，元素，颜色...
  - Audio event detection  
- 每回合算力有限。  
  - 保险方法是一边计算一边更新各个模块的当前指令。  
  - 敌人有 emp 武器，大幅降低算力。如何识别是否被 emp? 一边运算一边检测当前时间。  
- 蓄力武器。不同攻击范围的武器。  
- 机器人有动量。  
  - 引擎提供加速度。  
  - 有动量时撞到门会打开，惊醒敌人。  
  - 播放机器人行动时，移动仿佛不是回合制，而是匀加速减速。  
  - wall kick 来弹性地保持动能、改变朝向。  
    - 可以躲敌人预测机器人轨迹的 projectiles.  
  - 有不同种类的 actuator, 轮子，脚，悬浮...
- 元素。火，电，毒，冰。  
- 多模态。radio wave as info medium?  
- 各种传感器。  
- 护盾。  
- 反射激光的镜子。躲避导弹的闪现。防御动能武器的虫洞。  
- 是否加入 repetitive farming? 
  - 更吻合我最初写脚本打 pixel dungeon (overgrown) 的体验。  
  - 但现在想出了 10回合 failsafe 的机制，其实不需要鼓励玩家自动化了。
- 玩家使用 `input()` 或者其他 io 作弊？言语谴责。或者， runtime 超时。  
- 不要像 FTL 一样限制机器人模块总数。一个高级的 AI 应该能灵活运用各个模块，操作流畅，视觉效果好。  
  - 每局的 variation 怎么来？ FTL 中商店富足，因此需要限制飞船模块总数。 Failsafe 中可以通过刷出有限的宝物来决定玩家能有的模块组合。  
- 像 FTL, 搞个能量分配系统。(CPU 也能分配，增强算力？)  
  - 为什么要这样？一堆系统，有 CD, 都能无损地用，会不会更爽？怎样让 AI 更有趣？  
- 一个敌人（忍者？）  
  - 简单的 variation: 教你怎么躲/防他攻击。  
  - 难的 variation: 攻击 pattern 不变，但见到玩家会扔烟雾弹。AI 需要根据 timing 自己 perform 躲避序列。  
- 游戏的 prerequisite 是初级编程能力。这不是一个教育游戏，除非有人想写这个 MOD.  
- AI 和机器人对接的 API 有 documentation, 在网页上，比如用 ReadTheDoc 排版。  
- Inventory 要不要每个物品都有重量？影响移动加速度。
- 如何防止玩家在一层无限刷？  
  - 能量递减？  
    - 这样就鼓励节能打怪法，会 less 酷。可能解决方法：见到敌人会使你暂时神奇地获得功率。  
- 商店。 
  - 走近了才能看见货品。  
  - 可以击杀老板。通过计算货品对你的总价值，货品卖价，以及你击杀老板的成本，来做决定。    

## Quantum dungeon
- 使用 wave function collapse 生成地牢。  
- 但是每回合都会根据现有视野重新生成！包括道具，敌人。  
- 门开两次之后变成墙。  
- 开局就有目的地和宝物的视野，你需要多次尝试让走廊连过去。
