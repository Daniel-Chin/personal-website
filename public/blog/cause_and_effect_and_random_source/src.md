# Causality and trusted randomness
People say that the only way to study causality is by actively modulating input variables. It's a popular concept that "revealing causality requires human agents to actively affect the experiment". 

However, that idea leads to some strange consequences. Suppose you believe you have free will but every other human is just a predictable animate object. Then, should you trust other people's papers studying causation effects? 

I think there is a more central requirement: The input variable must be modulated by a source of randomness that is independent with the experiment. 

If there is a variable that is correlated with every source of randomness, it will be impossible to study causality with that variable.
