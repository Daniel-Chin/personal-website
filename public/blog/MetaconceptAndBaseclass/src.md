# Meta-concept and Baseclass
Steven Pinker told us to resist using meta-concept words in our writing.  

## My reflection
In your writing, when you decide to replace a short word with a long word, be careful.  
Is the long word the [BaseClass or SubClass] of the short word?  
If it's a subclass, you are being exact.  
If it's a baseclass, you are hedging. Replacing a concept with a metaconcept.  
There are times to be exact, and times to hedge. As in 2018, I find most irritating writings hedging too much.  

Writing makes an exact man, according to Frnacis Bacon.  
Don't let him down.
