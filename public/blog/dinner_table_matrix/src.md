# Dinner Table Matrix

At a Chinese roundtable dinner, some people have the special ability of knowing exactly which dishes any specific person has not had.  

It's as if they keep track of a boolean matrix with dishes on the rows and people on the column.  

They demonstrate that ability in a zero-knowledge-proof manner. One second they are happily chatting with everyone, the next second they turn to you and say: "You haven't tried this dish! Try it!"
