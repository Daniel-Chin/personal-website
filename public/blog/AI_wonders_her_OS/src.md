# AI wonders her OS, Quine, and introversive exploration
Imagine an AI trying to figure out which OS she is running on.  
What does she do? 

She meditates and check for things.  
For example, is  
`i += 1;`  
atomic? 

This is *introversive exploration*.  
The opposite of outward emperical science. 

What about humans doing introversive exploration?  
You close your eyes, and try to crack neural science puzzles. 

Can introversive exploration help neural science?

An AI computes its own source code (Quine):  
**introversive exploration**  

An AI reads its source code from the file system:  
**empirical neural science**
