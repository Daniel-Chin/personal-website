# Idea: camera-projector feedback control
Use a camera to capture what the projector projects on the wall. Optimize the control so that the produced image matches the desired image. 
- Project onto a colored, or even multi-colored wall. 
- Project onto irregular surfaces. 
  - For this, the camera needs to be near the (one) viewer's eyes. 
- Detect faces and blacken the region, so people don't get blind.
