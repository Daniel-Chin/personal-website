# Entropy, Darwinian process, Von Neumann Economy

Today I realize that apart from entropy increasing, another time-non-reversable process is the Darwinian process. 

Think about the Von Neumann Econ. We did not tell it to grow instead of shrink. But most of the time it grows. It has asymmetrical direction preference. This is due to its Darwinian nature. Very strange to think about. 

A Darwinian process: if a thing makes more of itself, we are gonna see more of it. 

What would be a Darwinian process in reverse time? Do we observe them? 

Can this provide insight into causality?
