# Abstraction boundary in puzzle games
Professor Margret Minsky told me the concept of *abstraction boundary*. We create the digital abstraction over the analog circuits. We create Python over c++. Minsky commented on how abstraction boundaries are broken when students play with breadboard circuits - curly cables picking up signals in the air and so on.  

Remember Anti-Chamber? 

[spoiler alert]

There is a terminal puzzle where you need to block a laser to open a door. However, the laser is placed at a distance so that if you leave the laser and approach the door, the door is going to close right before you can get through. The solution is to use the laser to give upward momentum to the door - do not open it fully! And then go for the door. Instead of falling from the top of the parabola, the door now first reaches the top (ideally) of the parabola and then falls down, giving you extra time. 

This puzzle got me thinking for multiple days. Finally beating was extremely satisfying and left my proud for days. Of course, this puzzle felt "unfit" with the rest of the game. First of all, the thinking skills it tests is drastically different from the thinking skills the game has built up within the player. But it doesn't stop here. 

The game has been training the player to build abstraction. Doors are simply conditional devices. You manage to set it to an open state, and you can go past doors. Of course, the players always know that the doors are simulated using a physics engine; but they soon learn to abstract that away. The final puzzle, however, breaks the abstraction boundary. 

Are there other puzzle games that requires the player to break abstraction boundaries?
