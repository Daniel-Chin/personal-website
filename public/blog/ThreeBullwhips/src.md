# Three Bullwhips
The Bullwhip Effect is seen in the Beer Game. The surges in the demand seen by the retailer is amplified through the chain of shipping and buffering, leading the factory to have very volatile order quantity.  

A similar effect also causes traffic jams. Sometimes a car decelerates, and the car behind it decelerates more, and so on, creating a self-scaling propogating congestion on a highway.  

Also, restaurant 等位叫号. In China popular restaurants issue incremental ID numbers to queuing customers. At many restaurants you see strange periodic volatility in the speed of number rolling. I have a theory to explain that. Say it starts slow - so many customers don't want to wait and just leave the queue. Following that will be a fast passing of numbers, which in turn make many customers believe it's worth waiting. Following that will be a slow passing of numbers; etc.  
Making the customers report "I'm leaving the queue" may remedy this effect.

What I noticed was one of the common properties of many PDE systems. The equilibrium of a dynamical system can either be a point or an attractor. When it is an attractor, we observe oscillations in some dimensions. 

What I described in paragraph 2 is called a phantom traffic jam.
