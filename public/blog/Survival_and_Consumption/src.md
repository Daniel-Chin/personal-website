# Survival and Consumption
The first need is survival. The second need is consumption. 

Consumption is not necessarily the "correct" second need; it's just a nice assumption to model the economy.  
The need to consume is a side-effect of slow evolution. 

If we think "The biggest arbitrage is to be happy without money",  
(which is because money is rival good and happiness is non-rival good,)  
then economic development for consumption is not necessary.  
Economic development for survival, though, would be about military power.  

Consumption without survival is 迷药乐园.  
(A scenario where the Earth is conquered by a civ. The civ provides infinite amount of drug and commodities and maintain the order of the Earth. Earth people are not allowed to have children. Earth civ perishes.)
