## Writing.  
There are 2 kinds of errors: writing errors & reading errors. A writing decision, maybe grammatically correct, but one that invites the reader to make reading errors, is bad!!!  
You can't just say "Nah, it's the readers' fault" & dismiss it.

## Unique Words. 
Long words are not necessarily bad. What damages readabilty is those long meta-concept words that everyone turns to when they don't know how to say what they want to say precisely.  
Readers have already associated these words with boredom.  
Don't group yourself with these boring writings!
