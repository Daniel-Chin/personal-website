# Sound of calligraphy
Weekly performance for [NIME @ NYUSH](https://wp.nyu.edu/shanghai-ima-nime/) with professor Eric Parren. Collaborator: Jiani Yang. 

## Concept
Last class the course introduced the *contact microphone* (based on the piezo sensor). To fully explore the affordance of the contact microphone, I want to amplify a sound that exists on a surface but does not travel by air very well, so we don't usually hear. Legacy ideas include:  
* amplify a suit case (with casters) that I drag on a tiled floor to make rhythm.  
* amplify the keypress noises of a MIDI keyboard.  

In the end I decide to amplify the sound of Chinese calligraphy. I have always been fascinated by the *rhythm of writing*. Even when written with pen, each Chinese character is associated with a unique rhythm pattern. Imagine "[word painting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_painting)" a Chinese song with rhythm taken from its lyrics. Imagine a ML model that infers the character from the sound of writing it.  

Along this line of thought, Jiani wants to incorporate more Eastern elements into the performance. She got bowls of green beans to mimic the sound of raining and a Victorian synth with grooves on a bolt to mimic the sound of fire crackling. Read [her documentation](placeholder) for more info.  

## Fabrication
Afraid that the signal may be too weak, I want to make the connection between the piezo and the brush as stiff as possible. Therefore, one side of the piezo directly contacts the brush, and the other side is firmly stationed onto the brush by hot glue. I added more hot glue to fixate a part of the cable onto the brush body to avoid stress on the soldering connection.  

The amplification module, the battery, and the speaker are all strapped onto my right arm while I use my right hand to hold the brush. This frees my left hand.  

## Performance execution and reflection
* My body blocked the canvas. Better rotate 90 degrees or use another stance.  
* When on stage, I wanted to force myself to look at the audience. This created timing mismatch with Jiani. However after observing other groups' performances, I found that interaction between performers can also be a cool component. On-stage communication should be studied.
