# Mouse Adaptor
My mouse is too small. It hurt my hand.

Gaming mouses are too expensive though, more expensive than 3D printing filament - which gave me an idea.  

I scanned my mouse with the laser scanner in the Tandon Makerspace.

To yield better scanning quality, I masked my black mouse with wet white tissues (not shown in video).  

The scanner gave me a 3D pointcloud of the mouse surface. I then downloaded a free 3D model of a gaming mouse. Importing the two models into Maya, I could fill the difference space with a low-poly shape. I added some patterns on top to make it look better.

I printed it with Ultimaker.

It finally fit my palm.
