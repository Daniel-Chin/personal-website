## Naming
- 鞋音 is 谐音 with 谐音。 So it's like a meta-pun!  
- 鞋音 refers to the resonance quality of a shoe.  

## Movie references
Many spy movies mention 鞋子电话， shoe phone. I don't know which original movie started the whole thing, but a recent one I watched that also referenced it was *Kingsman: The Secret Service*.

## But why???
First of all, the concept is just relentlessly funny.  

How did I think of using a shoe? Initially, I specified the following design goals:  
- Should sit stably on a flat surface. (no-round-bottom)  
- Professor Parren said something like "because [I made a cube](https://wp.nyu.edu/shanghai-ima-nime/build-a-speaker-cabinet/), none of you should make a cube." So no cubes.  
- Enclosed + rigid body to prevent stress on soldering connections.  
- I should be able to push a male 1/4-inch jack in without holding the female port. i.e. Rigid support underneath the female port.  

A shoe is a perfect solution!  

## Misc
Dave Santiano made a suggestion to make it stereo.  

Slap "like" if you want me to make it stereo.
