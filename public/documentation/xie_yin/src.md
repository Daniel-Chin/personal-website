## Naming
- 鞋音 is 谐音 with 谐音。 So it's like a meta-pun!  
- 鞋音 refers to the resonance quality of a shoe.  

## Movie references
Many spy movies mention 鞋子电话， shoe phone. I don't know which original movie started the whole thing, but a recent one I watched that also referenced it was *Kingsman: The Secret Service*.

Dave Santiano made a suggestion to make it stereo.  

Slap "like" if you want me to make it stereo.  
<button onclick="alert('Error: not enough shoe');">like (386)</button>
