# Carbon Emission Accounting

## Introduction
I want to see two numbers on a price tag: the dollar price and the total amount of carbon emission this product is responsible for. 

Here is why. There are many "Green life tricks" and "Earth-friendly lifestyles" circulating on the internet. However, many are unscalable; some even lead to net-negative outcomes. We need to know the *scale* of carbon emission related to our activities, so that we can weight our efforts accordingly. A "$ + C" price tag will inform us to make better decisions as consumers. Once our will to fight global warming is reflected in the market demand, the industries will have to listen. 

I can think of a way to acheive that, and it is:  
* Mathematically elegant, 
* A natural extension to the logic of Economy, 
* Enforcable at low implementation costs.
