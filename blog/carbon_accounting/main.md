# Carbon Emission Accounting

## Introduction
I want to see two numbers on a price tag: the dollar price and the total amount of carbon emission this product is responsible for. 

Here is why. Many "Green life tricks" circulating on the internet are unscalable; some even lead to net-negative outcomes. We need to know the *magnitude* of carbon emission related to our activities, so that we can weight our efforts accordingly. A "$ + Carbon" price tag will inform us to make better decisions as consumers. Once our will to fight global warming is reflected in the market demand, the industries will have to listen. 

I can think of a way to acheive that, and it is:  
* Mathematically elegant, 
* A natural extension to the logic of Economy, 
* Enforcable at low implementation costs. 

## The Laminar Cashflow and Why Capitalism Works
First, let's take a step back and look at why Capitalism works. The economy is all about resource allocation:  
* How people allocate time between work and leisure. 
* How people allocate investment among stocks. 
* How people allocate consumption among goods and services. 

The above three corresponds to three markets: the labor market, the capital market, and the consumer market.
